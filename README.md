# FAQ
## why you made this and didn't just use other software such as John's Background Switcher?
too much bloat and didn't have the features i actually wanted, such as shuffling
## why can't i change wallpapers more than every 99 hours and 66 minutes?
this is due to QTimer's limit, but also because i cannot see a good reason to why one would want to go over that, like what is wrong with you
## will this waste my ram?
it uses 4mb of ram last time i checked, i did have some troubles with memory leak's in other wallpaper switchers
## does this has bugs?
definitly
## will you updade this?
not sure, it has enough features for my personal usage
## why is everything in main?
i don't like headers
